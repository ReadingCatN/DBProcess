# Notes for Database and Python learning

## Background

### _Due to the restriction of direct access to ERP data, to better manage the business data for further analysis,_
### _to build my own database (<ins>releation database</ins>) seems to be a good way._

## Database 
### _Currently support <ins>PostgreSQL</ins> and <ins>mySQL</ins>, also exploring non-relational database like <ins>mongoDB</ins>._

## Languages
### _For postgreSQL, both VBA and python support perfect for database create, upgrade, read and delete, as well as batch insert_
### _For mySQL, VBA performs worse when it comes to batch insert, however python performs perfect_
### _This project is applying python,and library <ins>psycopg2</ins> and <ins>pymysql</ins> is required_
